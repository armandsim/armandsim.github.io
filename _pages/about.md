I am an applied microeconomist whose research evaluates major policy issues in health and public economics, with a focus on low- and middle-income countries, particularly Indonesia. My work focuses on how local values interact with incentives and information in shaping individual beliefs, behaviors, and outcomes.

My research has been published in European Economic Review, Health Economics, and World Development. I am an invited researcher at J-PAL.

I received my PhD in Applied Economics from Cornell University.
