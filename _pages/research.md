**[Selection and Behavioral Responses of Health Insurance Subsidies in the Long Run: Evidence from a Field Experiment in Ghana](/docs/AKS_Ghana_Published_Version_HE.pdf)** with Patrick Asuming and Hyuncheol Bryant Kim <br>

We study the effects of a health insurance subsidy in Ghana, where mandates are not enforceable. We randomly provide different levels of subsidy (1/3, 2/3, and full) and evaluate the impact at seven months and three years after the intervention. We find that a one-time subsidy increased insurance enrollment for all groups in both the short and long runs, but health care utilization in the long run increased only for the partial subsidy group. We find supportive evidence that ex-post behavioral responses rather than ex-ante selective enrollment explain the long-run health care utilization results.

In settings where resistance and rampant misinformation against vaccines exist, the prospect of containing infectious diseases remains a challenge. Can delivery of information regarding the benefits of vaccination through personal home visits by local ambassadors increase vaccine uptake? We conduct a door-to-door randomized information campaign targeted towards COVID-19 unvaccinated individuals in rural Indonesia. We recruited ambassadors from local villages tasked to deliver information about COVID-19 vaccines and promote vaccination through one-on-one meetings, using an interpersonal behavioral change communication approach. To investigate which type of ambassador—health cadres, influential individuals, and laypersons—is the most effective, we randomly vary the type of ambassador that delivers the information at the village level. We find that the overall vaccination take-up is quite moderate and that there are no differences in vaccination outcomes across the treatment groups. These results highlight the challenge of boosting vaccine uptake in late stages of a pandemic.

**[The Consequences of Child Market Work on the Growth of Human Capital](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X15308731?via%3Dihub)** with Asep Suryahadi and Daniel Suryadarma <br>
*World Development, 2017, 91: 144–155.*

The paper measures the effect of child market work on the long-term growth of human capital, focusing on the output of the human capital production: mathematics skills, cognitive skills, pulmonary function, and educational attainment. Our full sample is drawn from a rich longitudinal dataset Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS). We address endogeneity of child market work using provincial legislated minimum wage as the instrument. Our instrumental variable estimation shows that child labor negatively affects mathematics skills and pulmonary function, but not cognitive skills and educational attainment. We find heterogeneities in type of work. Those who work outside of family business have lower educational attainment than those working for family business.

**[Can Religion and Science Play a Complementary Role in Raising Environmental Awareness?](/docs/jakarta_draft.pdf)** with Sarah Gultom, Umair Khalil, Wang-Sheng Lee, and Alyas Widita <br>
*Submitted*

<summary>[abstract]</summary>
This paper examines whether religion and science, which are often seen as opposing perspectives, can act as complementary forces in influencing environmental beliefs and attitudes. We explore this question through an online experiment in Jakarta---the world’s fastest-sinking city---where we randomize exposure to video messages containing different narrative framing (religious vs. scientific) and presenter identity (Imam vs. scientist portrayed by the same actor). Several patterns emerge. First, compared to a placebo, all treatment messages increase respondents' beliefs about land subsidence, willingness to adopt mitigation behaviors, and confidence in their ability to address the problem. Second, the scientist portrayal, which is perceived as more persuasive and trustworthy, generates stronger effects when combined with a religious narrative, highlighting the complementary role between scientific credibility and religious values. Third, effects on beliefs are larger among those with low prior knowledge and high institutional trust, but heterogeneous effects on mitigation behaviors are limited. These findings suggest that perceived scientific credibility combined with religious narratives can effectively shape public understanding and influence action on environmental challenges.
